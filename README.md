## Problem
Can we predict rodent behavior?  We will use various features including sanitation, business types, and weather to predict the likelihood of initial and compliance rat inspection findings [passed, rat activity, bait applied, failed for other reasons]. Rat activity includes 1) fresh tracks, 2) fresh droppings, 3) active burrows, 4) active runways and rub marks, 5) fresh gnawing marks, and 6) live rats; all of these signs will be classified under the finding [rat activity]. This would help more efficiently allocate resources (both equipment and inspectors).
